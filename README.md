# Dog Walking & Grooming Business Database

## Description
This project includes a MySQL database for managing a dog walking and grooming business. The database tracks **customers**, **pets**, **appointments**, **services**, and **payments**, making it easier for the business to manage operations. The system includes both **SQL scripts** for creating the database and an **Access database file** for interacting with the data.

## Files in this Repository:
- **ER_Diagrams/**: Contains digital and hand-drawn **Chen ER diagrams**.
- **SQL_Scripts/**: Includes the **SQL scripts** used to create and populate the database.
- **DogWalkingGroomingBusiness.accdb**: The **Access database** file that holds the actual data.
- **final_report.pdf**: A report summarizing the design and development of the project.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project and its contents.

## How to Use:
1. **SQL Scripts**:
   - Run the **DogWalkingGroomingBusiness.sql** script in MySQL to create the necessary tables and insert sample data.
   - Follow the script's order to ensure the tables are created correctly and that the relationships between the tables are established properly.

2. **Access Database**:
   - Open the **DogWalkingGroomingBusiness.accdb** file in Microsoft Access to view and interact with the database. 
   - You can use the tables, forms, and queries in Access to manage data related to customers, pets, employees, and appointments.

## Future Improvements:
- **Automated Appointment Reminders**: Add features to automatically send reminders to customers and employees about upcoming appointments.
- **Online Payment Integration**: Integrate an online payment system to make payments more convenient.
- **Customer Loyalty Program**: Track loyalty points for regular customers as a way to reward them for returning business.
